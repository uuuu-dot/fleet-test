# Helm Example

This example will deploy the [Kubernetes sample guestbook](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/guestbook/) application backend packaged as a Helm chart.
The app will be deployed into the `fleet-helm-example` namespace.
It will be deployed as part of the [multi-gitrepo](https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/tree/master/single-cluster/multi-gitrepo) example.
